# Changelog

## 0.9.7 (unreleased candidate)

- Remove Cloud Source `state.update`, enable/disable capabilities, `desiredState`, and enable-related MQTT authorization confirmation. A Source can be used after creation; deleting it stops subsequent use.
- Keep actual Source runtime and health observations, revision checks, credential authorization, and confirmation for referenced connection changes or deletion. Name/description-only edits do not need impact confirmation.
- Use Unicode character limits of 63 for Source names and 512 for descriptions.
- Document direct deletion of active Streams and update Source/Stream examples to the shorter lifecycle.

The Source lifecycle contract is pinned to Backend commit `87a2bc316fbae69448e58dd66e38450c744793b5`. This candidate is not published to npm; install the verified tarball for integration testing against that backend contract.
